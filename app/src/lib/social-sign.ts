 * keeps replay protection meaningful for those fields too.

 * The base is `post:${text}`; attachments append stable markers:
 *   :img            when an inline image is attached
 *   :tok:<address>  when a token preview is attached
 *   :q:<postId>     when the post quotes another post
 *
 * This lives in its own pure module (no client/server-only imports) precisely so
 * both sides import the same function and cannot drift. verify.ts is untouched.

 * (post / reply / like / repost) the client signs THIS exact string so one
 * signature satisfies both the off-chain store and the on-chain contract:

 *   ansem social: {kind}:{subject}\nts: {ts}\n{text}
 *
 * - kind    : "post" | "reply" | "like" | "repost"
 * - subject : the target post's on-chain id (decimal) for reply/like/repost, "" for a post
 * - text    : the content for post/reply, "" for like/repost
 *
 * This must match contracts/social/src/lib.rs `canonical_message` byte-for-byte.
 * Attachments (image/token/quote) are NOT bound here; they are stored off-chain
 * as metadata alongside the on-chain-authenticated text.
